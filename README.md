## Introduction
Same as Chromium OS, openFyde adopts the [Portage build and packaging system](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage) from Gentoo Linux. openFyde uses Portage with certain customisations to support building multiple targets (bootable OS system images) across different hardware architectures from a shared set of sources.

A **board** defines a target type, it can be either for a family of hardware devices or specifically for one type of device. For example, The board `amd64-openfyde` is a target type for an openFyde system image that aims to run on most recent PCs with amd64(x86_64) architecture; whilst the `rpi4-openfyde` board is a target type specifically for the infamous single-board computer [Raspberry Pi 4B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/). We usually append `-openfyde` to the board name in openFyde to differentiate between its siblings for FydeOS.

Each board has a corresponding **overlay** that defines the configuration for it. This includes details like CPU architecture, kernel configuration, as well as additional packages and USE flags.

## About the board `orangepi5-openfyde`
 - This board specifically targets the [Orange Pi 5](http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-5.html), [Orange Pi 5B](http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-5B.html) and [Orange Pi 5 Plus](http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-5-plus.html):

### üë®‚Äçüîß Installation 
1.  Download the release file with the .run extension
2. Make the file executable by running the command `chmod +x <filename>.run` and then execute the file depending on your target storage type:
   
   - For orange pi 5 with NVME, execute:
       ```
        ./orangepi5-openfyde-rxxx.run --board orangepi5 --boot nvme
       ```
   - For orange pi 5 with SATA, execute:
       ```
        ./orangepi5-openfyde-rxxx.run --board orangepi5 --boot sata
        ```
   - For orange pi 5b, execute:
       ```
       ./orangepi5-openfyde-rxxx.run --board orangepi5b --boot emmc
       ```
   - For orange pi 5plus with NVME, execute:
       ```
       ./orangepi5-openfyde-rxxx.run --board orangepi5plus --boot nvme
       ```
   - For orange pi 5plus with EMMC, execute:
       ``` 
       ./orangepi5-openfyde-rxxx.run --board orangepi5plus --boot emmc
       ```
   
    Or, you can just simply run`./orangepi5-openfyde-rxxx.run` without any flag or parameter; the command line prompt will ask you questions to help you decide the `--board` and `--boot` values.
   
    The image `orangepi5-openfyde-rxxx.img` that supports booting from SATA/NVMe/eMMC per your choice will then be generated in the current directory.

3.  Flash the image to a TF (microSD) card using your favourite tool, e.g. [dd](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dd.1.html) or [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/).

#### ‚ùóImportant notes:
 - All images generated from the .run file will support booting from a TF (microSD) card. The 'target storage' means the storage type where you want to install openFyde while running the openFyde installer. 
 - The installation process is necessary for some features to work, for example, the "local OTA update" feature introduced since this release; hence it's recommended to carry it out if you want to keep your openFyde OS and use it regularly in the future.
 - You can flash the image directly to your onboard storage(SATA/NVMe/eMMC). However, you can then only choose the **Try It First** button at OOBE; you WILL NOT be able to perform installation under this circumstance.
 - The installation process takes approximately 10 minutes, depending on the storage speed.

### üîÑ Manual Update
Download the file `payload.bin` to your device and execute `openfyde-updater.sh <path_to_payload.bin>` as the root user to perform the upgrade.
